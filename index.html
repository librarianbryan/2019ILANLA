				 		4) This is of particular interest to libraries because our professional ethics emphasize privacy. At least since 1939 libraries have protected privacy to preserve the intellectual freedom of their communities. Most public libraries are government entities. The way the public works department is out after a storm fixing the power lines, the way that firefighters are risk themselves to fight fires, they way police are keeping us safe, the way public defenders are represent the rights of those charged with crimes, we have a unique duty to protect privacy. This is a public good and transcends commercial interests.

Librarians and other information workers support and participate in transparency so that the workings of government, administration and business are opened to the scrutiny of the general public.

Amazon records you everything read, down to the page number. They also know everything you buy. Overdrive and Hoopla are very upfront about recording everything you read, but they will it hide it from you if you insist.

They use "fear of missing out" (FOMO) or straigt up deception to get you to make the choices they want. Here's an example from my own library. Other examples: are you sure you don't want enable desktop notifications? Or resetting all your preferences between updates. Or just subtle psychological shaming of Overdrive or Hoopla.

					54) Thanks to EU's GDPR (General  Data Protection Regulation) we know that Spotify collects every click, what headphones you use, window size, what files you dropped and dropped. It is not a music playing machine. It is a recording machine. This is the desktop app. If we consider the same data collection on via phone app, it also knows where you are at what time, when you sleep, if your moving fast and slow, etc. Your phone is literally an extention of yourself and we are all, no joke, cyborgs. That is a different talk.

					55) Phones are fundamentally insecure. If you are using a phone your phone company knows your general location at all times. And we know now the sell this info. The text function in your phone is unencrypted unless you use a special app. We know on Android many apps collect data even without you knowing. Apple isn't open source so it is harder to study. A lot of apps have remote microphone access. The phone knows when you sleep, when you poop, who your friends are, who you work with, that what you think about, what music and tv shows you like, what porn you like, what church you feel guilty about not going to, and if you wear a fitness tracker it knows when you dream, it knows a lot more. No one has more info about you than your phone. Not your doctor, not your mom, not your spouse. Well, maybe Google if your phone was made by Google. DMCA makes it illegal for you to root your phone. You are only allowed to root your phone and change its software because of a special exception to DMCA determined by Librarian of Congress as recommended by the Register of Copyrights.

					56) Facebook is always watching you. Even when you are not on Facebook. Non-PII data from coookies  can be reverse engineered via the mosaic effect. Academic studies have shown this for years. If this wasn't the case, Facebook would have no reason to track you when you don't use their site. The Yale Privacy Lab found that many popular apps on Android, like Weather Channel, Lyft, and Tinder (to name a few) are loaded with third-party trackers. Privacy International found that 61% of apps they tested sent data to Facebook whether you had a Facebook account or not. We know this because Android is open source. If these researchers found the same results with iOS it would illegal to share it because of the DMCA.

She was a real hot commodity during the last presidential election. More about my mother later. What if you got the data you got was wrong? I should note Cambridge Analytica got their data in a clandestine manner, and we know about it because of a whistle blower. They just got caught. This kind of profiling is happening all the time, mostly to target ads at you, or have just in case because they might want to target ads at you in the future.

You might hear that privacy is dead. This ship has sailed. Well, can I have your password? Climate change is bad, does that mean we are going to stop? A few high profile men have brought to justice for sex crimes, does that mean we've   solved the problem of sexual violence? Grand juries rarely recommend charges against the police. Does that mean were going stop fighting for justice in our communities? We're libraries. We fight. I love and respect my mom. She's a senior citizen with a high school education. She uses an Android tablet that no longer gets security updates. She doesn't deserve annoying, misleading ads. She does not deserve her 4th amendment rights violated for ads. She does not deserve malware, identity theft, fakes news or a loan with criminally bad terms. More importantly she has a human right not be surveilled.
